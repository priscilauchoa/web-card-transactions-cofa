# Card Transaction Overview

Assesment for [this task](TASK.md)

### Some information about the solution:

* Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Emotion (styles).
* Node: v21.6.2
* Yarn: v1.22.22

I utilized the provided API to retrieve data for both the card and the transaction entities. 
Furthermore, I extended the card data model by incorporating the "type" property to distinguish between private and business cards.
This enabled me to tailor the styling of transactions dynamically, ensuring consistency with the selected card.

### Running the app

#### Install dependencies

```yarn```

By default it will run in the following address:
http://localhost:5173/
